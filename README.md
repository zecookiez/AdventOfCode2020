## AdventOfCode2020
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays üéÑ

All of these solutions will be written and verified with Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python (no PyPy or JIT compilers) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

## Notable Nights

- Day 1: Site went down, and apparently I did not refresh it fast enough.
- Day 3: Kept the extra newlines in the data, immediately regretted my decision.
- Day 9: Two lessons learned: always preprocess input, and always go for the simpler solution (unless it's too slow but I should've checked).
- Day 10: Should've read the end of the problem first, because I solved the wrong problem for part 1.
- Day 12: Getting good sleep is important!
- Day 14: Reading is hard ;-;
- Day 18: Took a "nap" and woke up way after the contest began...
- Day 21: I don't understand how I misunderstood the problem this badly.
- Day 22: Lost all my time from a misleading example and a hidden key point. The bad streak continues...
- Day 23: The bad streak continues... The good news is that I completed all of my schoolwork so I can focus on AOC now :)
- Day 24: The bad streak continues...

## Final Reflections

- Keeping some templates would be nice (double newline input parsing, bipartite matching, linked list)
- I should brush up on regexes
- I should practice number theory and linked lists problems
- Be less afraid of attempting backtracking
- Set an alarm for 30 minutes before every night
- Reading skills are important ;-;
- Debugging skills are important ;-;

With that being said, I am more than happy about my performance this year. This is not only the first year I've made it to the top 100, but the first year I completed all 25 days as well. Looking forward to Advent of Code 2021!
