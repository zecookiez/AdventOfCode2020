## AdventOfCode2020
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays üéÑ

All of these solutions will be written and verified with Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python (no PyPy or JIT compilers) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

## Notable Nights

- Day 1: Site went down, and apparently I did not refresh it fast enough.
- Day 3: Kept the extra newlines in the data, immediately regretted my decision.
